Track-A-Worm (version 2.0)

Version 2 now comprises three components: WormTracker, SleepTracker, and Action Potential Analyzer. The WormTracker is an update of the original [Track-A-Worm](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069653), featuring substantial improvements in functionality. Below is a list of the major additions and enhancements:

Option to differentiate between ventral and dorsal sides.
Implementation of image recording in greatly reduced file sizes (approximately 16.0 KB at 100% camera resolution and 4.0 KB at 50% camera resolution), thereby conserving storage space and expediting subsequent analysis.
Implementation of body curvature quantification.
Capability to track and analyze worms on nematode culture plates with a layer of OP50 or other bacteria.
Automatic spline fitting for virtually all worm shapes.
Option to integrate external devices (e.g. a light source for optogenetic stimulation) through TTL signals.
Plotting of forward and backward locomotion profiles.
Resolution of a significant bug in the original version, with no other bugs identified in the current version.
